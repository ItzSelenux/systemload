# systemload
A simple reading of the system load for humans

## How does it work

It fetches information of the system's load average from /proc/loadavg and the amount of cores from /proc/cpuinfo
(similar to grep "Processor" /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l)


## To Do

Regional settings. Right now it's all in English. I will add a file for language choice later on.


And, as usual, these little projects are just for fun and educational. Feel free to fork it and send me your improved versions for a merge request!

Goodbye!

Alexia.
